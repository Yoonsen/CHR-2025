The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb ""did"" is conjugated incorrectly. The correct form would be ""which article did you throw away without reading?"" or ""which article did you throw away without reading?"".

In the first example, the sentence should be ""which article did you throw away without reading?"".

In the second example, the sentence should be ""which article did you throw away without reading?"".

Both examples are grammatically correct and have the same meaning.

In summary, the sentence ""which article did you throw away without reading"" is grammatically incorrect and should be corrected to ""which article did you throw away without reading?"" or ""which article did you throw away without reading?"".

The corrected sentence would be:

""Which article did you throw away without reading?""

or

""Which article did you throw away without reading?""

Both examples are grammatically correct and have the same meaning.

In summary, the corrected sentence would be:
